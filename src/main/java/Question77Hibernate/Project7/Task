Hotel Reservation System: Create a system for hotel bookings, including room availability, reservation management, and billing.

Creating a complete Hotel Reservation System using Java and Hibernate is a substantial project, and providing the entire solution here is not feasible due to its complexity. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Reservation entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete Hotel Reservation System.
