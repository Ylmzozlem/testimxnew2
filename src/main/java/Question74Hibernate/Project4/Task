Blog Platform: Create a blog platform where users can write and publish articles, comment on posts, and manage their content.

Creating a full-fledged Blog Platform using Java and Hibernate is a substantial project, and providing the entire project solution here is not feasible. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Post entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete project.
