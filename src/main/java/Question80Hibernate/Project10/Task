Online Quiz System: Develop an online quiz platform with different types of questions, user accounts, and score tracking.



Creating a complete Online Quiz System using Java and Hibernate is a significant project, and providing the entire solution here is not feasible due to its complexity. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Quiz entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete Online Quiz System.
