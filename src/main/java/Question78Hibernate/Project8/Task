Student Information System: Build a student information management system for schools or universities.


Creating a complete Student Information System (SIS) using Java and Hibernate is a substantial project, and providing the entire solution here is not feasible due to its complexity. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Student entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete Student Information System.
