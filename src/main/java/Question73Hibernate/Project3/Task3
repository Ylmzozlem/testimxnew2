Task Management System: Develop a task management application that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks.

Creating a full Task Management System using Java and Hibernate is a complex task, and providing the entire project solution is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Task entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete project.
