Online Shopping Cart: Build an e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete purchases.

Creating a full-fledged Online Shopping Cart project using Java and Hibernate is quite extensive, and providing the entire project solution is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Product entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project, which is a fundamental part of an online shopping cart system. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete project.
