Expense Tracker: Develop an application that helps users track their expenses, income, and budget.

Creating a complete Expense Tracker project using Java and Hibernate is a significant undertaking, and providing the entire solution here is not feasible due to its complexity. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of an Expense entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete Expense Tracker system.
