Inventory Management System: Build a system for tracking inventory in a warehouse, including product details and stock levels.

Creating a complete Inventory Management System (IMS) using Java and Hibernate is a complex project, and providing the entire solution here is not feasible. However, I can provide you with a simplified example of a Product entity and repository in a Java-Hibernate project. You can use this as a starting point and expand upon it to build a complete IMS.
